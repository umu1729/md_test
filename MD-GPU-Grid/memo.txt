which is the best choice:

1. 
        //Kernel:Hashing (Generate Hash And Embed key)
        //Kernel:Sort Key based on Hash.
        //Kernel:Align "All" data based on sorted-Key,and Generate Hash range reference map(HRRM).
        //Kernel:using Aligned data and HRRM,calculate Force fast.
        1.1 Aligned data must be used for Next Steps;
        1.2 Aligned data must be thrown away and use Non-Aligned data.
2.
        //Kernel:Hashing (Generate Hash And Embed key)
        //Kernel:Sort Key based on Hash.
        //Kernel:Generate Hash range reference map(HRRM).
        //Kernel:using Non-Aligned data and HRRM and Sorted Key-Hash,calculate Force fast.
